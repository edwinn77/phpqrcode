1. PHP Extensions
While phpqrcode doesn't typically require additional PHP extensions, it's good to ensure your PHP setup has all the basic extensions enabled. These include gd for image processing functionalities. You can check this by:

Open your php.ini file (found in C:\xampp\php\php.ini for XAMPP).
Search for the following line and make sure it is uncommented (remove the ; at the beginning if present):

*extension=gd*


Restart Apache from the XAMPP control panel after making this change.
